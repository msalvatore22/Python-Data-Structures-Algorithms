# Linked List
A form of sequential collection that does not have to be in order. Made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference to the next node in the linked list.

## Linked List vs Array
* Elements of linked list are independent objects
* Linked list size is variable
* Insertion and removals in linked list are efficient
* Random access is very efficient in arrays

## Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List
    * No reference to the previous node
    * Node has value and reference to next node
    * Last node reference is Null
2. Cicurlar Linked List
    * Last node has a reference to the first node
3. Doubly Linked List
    * Node references the next node and the previous node
4. Circular Doubly Linked List
    * Doubly linked list with a tail that references the head

## Linked List In Memory
* Stored in memory non-contiguously
