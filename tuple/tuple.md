# Tuples
An immutable sequestion of Python objects \
Tuples are also comparable and hashable \
Enclosed by paranthesis

## Working with Tuples
* Access elements like a list using bracket operator
* Slice operator [:], [leftIndex:rightIndex]
* in operator

## Methods
* tuple.count() -> number of occurences
* tuple.index() -> index of value
* tuple(list) -> convert list to tuple

## Tuple vs List
* List is mutable, tuples are immutable.
* Tuples can be stored in lists, lists can be stored in tuples. Tuples can be stored in tuples.
* Tuples generally used for heterogeneous data types, lists for homogeneous data types.

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | 
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Creation | O(1) | O(N) |
| Taverse | O(N) | O(1) |
| Access | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(1) | O(1) |
